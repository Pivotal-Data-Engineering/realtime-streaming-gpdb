<h1> VMware has ended active development of this project, this repository will no longer be updated.</h1><br># Real time streaming to Greenplum 

This demonstrates real time streaming of data generated by data generators to Greenplum

# Setup

This assumes Greenplum and kafka running.

Login to kafka machine and create a 'tradetopic' using the below command

kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic tradetopic

Create a Greenplum table using the scripts/trade-table-create.sql

Change the configurations of Greenplum and Kafka environment details in scripts/gpkafka-load-trade-table.yaml 

# Build 

mvn package

Login to machine where GPKafka is installed and run below command 

gpkafka load  --verbose scripts/gpkafka-load-trade-table.yaml

# Run 
Run the data generator app

java -jar spring-boot-kafka-producer-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

As the data is getting generated, the data is loaded into the Greenplum trade table.
